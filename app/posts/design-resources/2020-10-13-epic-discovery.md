Epic discoveries are a good opportunity for user research to help define user needs and gain early insight alongside working with product to help develop the epic.

The [research the problem] example is a great way to help aid the discovery process.

## What will user research do?

User research will work with product and design to:
* define what we currently know
* what do we need to research next?
* what do we need to build?

**Next UR will:**
* have an initial run of sessions gaining insight from customers  
* summarise findings
