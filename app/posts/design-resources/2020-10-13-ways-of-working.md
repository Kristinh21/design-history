## What is a ways of working?

Ways of working helps to empower people to work where, when and how they choose – with maximum flexibility and minimum constraints – to optimise their performance and to do their best work”.

It's important for the design team to create a process to help aid delivery within an agile team. This helps to create:
* a greater awareness for design within the team
* a clear process of how work should be delivered
* an awareness of time frames for designing and testing
