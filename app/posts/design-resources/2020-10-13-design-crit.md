This template has been created to allow designers to have their work critiqued amongst design communities and the wider team. It uses Mural an online whiteboard which helps promote group interaction.  

## How to use the board

### Step 1 - Background
Use the section to present the background of the project, include:
* service name
* service purpose
* who are the users
* what are the users needs/goals

### Step 2 - Supporting materials
Use the section to show:
* existing user research
* design patterns that helped influence the design

### Step 3 - Purpose of the critique
Use this statement to help:
* determine the design stage of your work
* explain the problem you are facing
* why you are having this problem
* the areas you are looking feedback on
* what constraints/limitations your are facing

### Step 4 - Designs
This is spilt into two parts.
**Part 1**
* map out the user flow
* identify where your design sits within the flow
* draw attention to areas of interest

**Part 2**
* add screen Designs
* talk the group through each one
* focus on your thinking behind each design

### Step 5 - Feedback
Using the post-it notes have the group provide feedback.
* set a time limit for feedback
* have everyone provide silent feedback
* green post-it for feedback
* blue post-it for questions
* at the end of the silent feedback session run through each post-it and allow for discussions


### Step 6 - Summarise
After the session spend time with the design team to:
* summarise key points
* are there any pending questions?
* create next steps
