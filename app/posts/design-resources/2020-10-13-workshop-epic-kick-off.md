## Why have an epic kickoff?
* It helps to get a shared understanding of what the team is about to embark on.
* Use the groups knowledge to plan and create the next steps.


### Understanding the epic
* what are we doing it?
* what is the end user impact?
* who are the stakeholders?
* how will we measure success?
* are there any metrics to keep track of?
* what is the definition of done?

### Preparing for the road ahead
* what milestones do we have along the way?
* can work be divided in a way to provide us value or valuable learnings early?
* is the first step crystal clear?

### Potential bumps in the road
* do we have any dependencies?
* if so, are they aware of our plans and wont block us?
* any other risks that should be taken into account?

### What's next for design and UR ?
User research and design will work together over a couple of sprints to:
* learn more about the epic
* explore design ideas
* create hypothesis based on user needs
* gain feedback from users

Throughout this process user stories will be added and removed as necessary. Scope is flexible and based on customer feedback and team cadence.

### How to break down and epic
There is no one size fits all solution for creating stories from an epic, but there are a lot of good options to consider.

* **User role or persona** — Create a unique story for each user persona. “Quicker login for new visitors,” “quicker login for return customers,” etc.

* **Ordered steps** — Break down the process and create a story for each step.

* **Culture** — Let team norms dictate if a story is a quick task or a week-long project.

* **Time** — Barring another agreed-upon convention, design stories that can be completed in one sprint or less.
