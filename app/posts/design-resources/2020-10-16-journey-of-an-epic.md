An overview of the stages in which an epic is created, explored, designed and delivered.

## Stage 1: Discovery & research

Product and User Research working together to explore the epic.

### Identify & define
To build the epic out they will:
* carry out user research (will vary depending on epic)
* document insights & painpoints
* list user needs
* list business needs
* list legislation

### Map ‘AS-IS'
To understand more they will:
* research the AS-IS process
* map out AS-IS flows

### Evidence
To gain more context they will:
* list examples and scenarios
* collate existing documentation



## Stage2: Define

The epic is populated with context and findings.

### Early inclusion
It's important to gain an early perspective from:
* SMEs
* Product team
* Tech (TA's)

This assists in picking up on any blockers or work that needs to be done up front alongside creating a rough t-shirt size of the epic.


### Evidence
Populate the epic with:
* examples and scenarios
* existing documentation
* screen shots of the AS-IS process

### Clear need
Populate the epic with:
* the problem statement
* statement of intent
* goals & outcomes

### Prioritise
Populate the epic with:
* user needs
* what is MVP 1
* what is MVP 2
* what is not MVP

## Stage 3: Epic kickoff with the team

Product will introduce the epic to the team.

### Why have an epic kickoff?
* It helps to get a shared understanding of what the team is about to embark on.
* Uses the groups knowledge to plan and create the next steps.


### Understanding the epic
* why are we doing it?
* what is the end user impact?
* who are the stakeholders?
* how will we measure success?
* are there any metrics to keep track of?
* what is the definition of done?

### Preparing for the road ahead
* what milestones do we have along the way?
* can work be divided in a way to provide us value or valuable learnings early?
* is the first step crystal clear?

### Potential bumps in the road
* do we have any dependencies?
* if so, are they aware of our plans and wont block us?
* any other risks that should be taken into account?



## Stage 4: The Design process
The design process depending on the size of the epic and testing availability of users can vary between 2-4 sprints.

### Research
* User research to uncover questions raised from epic kickoff
* Talk with SME's / users to answer questions
* feedback findings at the design kickoff
* document early findings on the design history site

### Design AS-IS / TO-BE workshop
* Design/Content will run a workshop with the Product, Tech and SME's to map out high level TO-BE flows
or
* Design/Content will create TO-BE flows and then have a session to review with Product, Tech and SME's.


### Design kickoff
Kick off session with the design team. The team will:
* plan how they will section out the work
* allow research to begin to draw up research plans
* allow research to begin to recruit users
* map user needs
* create hypothesis
* map/update the service flow

After the design kickoff session, design and content will work together to:
* mock up high fidelity user flows
* mock up high fidelity screens
* document the process on the design history site



### Design review
After the design team has created/explored solutions they will set up a design review session to:
* review design work with PO, BA, Tech & SME's
* agree on a solution that is aligned and within effort
* BA will create shell stories
* PO to sign off design work ready for prototyping

### Creating the prototype
Design/Content will:
* create a new version of the prototype for testing
* work with UR to create the best scenarios for testing
* document the process on the design history site
* run PO & BA through prototype
* BA will add more detail to the stories

## Stage 5: Test and Iterate
User research will take the prototype out for testing. After their testing session they will:
* create a playback slide deck
* organise a playback session to the team

### Play back session
During this session the User researcher will:
* playback the findings from the user testing sessions
* raise areas for concern
* provide recommendations

During this session the PO will:
* understand what needs addressing
* make a decision with the design team on what to update
* agree on a forward approach
* BA will update the user stories

### Update designs based on UR
Design/Content will:
* update designs
* update prototype
* document process on the design history site

If it's a drastic change they will test again.

## Stage 6: Estimation session
After the designs are ready for development there will be an estimation session. This session will include Tech leads, BA's and PO and the Design team. During this session they will break the Epic into smaller parts, estimate and prioritise stories.


## Stage 7: Tech design and test analysis
After the designs have been added to the cards and signed off by product.
Tech and test will then:
* work on the tech design
* work on the test analysis

for each card before moving them to ready for Refinement.


## Stage 8:  Ready for Refinement
For each story that includes designs there will:
* be one source of truth attached (pdf)
* [front end doc? discuss with Martin]

Important!
* the prototype will never be used for development guidance
* design & content will also sign off dev work (visual designs)

### Refinement
Design will:
* refine stories with the dev team
* run through design PDF’s
