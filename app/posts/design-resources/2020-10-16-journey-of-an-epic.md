An overview of the stages in which an epic is created, explored, designed and delivered.

## Stage 1: Discovery & research

Product and User Research working together to explore the epic.

### Identify & define
To build the epic out we:
* carry out user research (will vary depending on epic)
* document insights & painpoints
* list user needs
* list business needs
* list legislation

### Map 'as is'
To understand more we:
* research AS IS
* map out AS IS flows

### Evidence
To gain more context we:
* list examples and scenarios
* document existing documentation



## Stage2: Define

Epic is populated with context and findings

### Early inclusion
Gain an early perspective from:
* SMEs
* Product team
* Tech

This allows to pick up on any blockers or work that needs to be done up front.


### Evidence
Populate the epic with:
* examples and scenarios
* existing documentation
* screen shots of AS IS

### Clear need
Populate the epic with:
* the problem statement
* statement of intent
* goals & outcomes

### Prioritise
Populate the epic with:
* user needs
* what MVP 1 is
* what MVP 2 is
* what is not MVP

## Stage 3: Epic kickoff with team

Product will introduce the epic to the team

### Why have an epic kickoff?
* It helps to get a shared understanding of what the team is about to embark on.
* Use the groups knowledge to plan and create the next steps.


### Understanding the epic
* what are we doing it?
* what is the end user impact?
* who are the stakeholders?
* how will we measure success?
* are there any metrics to keep track of?
* what is the definition of done?

### Preparing for the road ahead
* what milestones do we have along the way?
* can work be divided in a way to provide us value or valuable learnings early?
* is the first step crystal clear?

### Potential bumps in the road
* do we have any dependencies?
* if so, are they aware of our plans and wont block us?
* any other risks that should be taken into account?



## Stage 4: Design process
The design process depending on the size of the epic and testing availability of users can vary between 2-4 sprints.

### Research
* User research uncover questions from kickoff
* Work with SME's / users to answer questions
* Feedback at design kickoff
* document early findings on design history site

### Design AS-IS / TO-BE workshop
* Design run a workshop with product to map out high level TO-BE flows
or
* Design create TO-BE flows and then have a session to review with product

### Design kickoff
Kick off session with the design team. The team will:
* plan how they will section out the work
* allow research to begin to draw up research plans
* allow research to begin to recruit users
* map user needs
* create hypothesis
* map service flow

After the design kickoff session design and content will work together to:
* mock high fidelity users flows
* mock high fidelity screens
* document process on design history site

### Design review
After design has a couple of flows mocked up there will be a session to:
* review design work with PO, BA & Tech
* agree solution is aligned and within effort
* BA will create shell stories
* PO to sign off design work ready for prototyping

### Create prototype
Design will:
* create a new version of the prototype for testing
* work with UR to create the best scenarios for testing
* document process on design history site
* run PO & BA through prototype
* BA will add more story detail

## Stage 5: Test and Iterate
User research will take the prototype out for testing. After their testing session they will:
* create a playback slide deck
* organise a playback session to the team

### Play back session
During this session PO will:
* understand what needs addressing
* make a decision with the design team on what to update
* agree on a forward approach
* BA will update user stories

### Update date designs based on UR
Design will:
* update designs
* update prototype
* document process on design history site

If it's a drastic change we will test again.

## Stage 6:  Ready for dev team
For each story that includes designs there will:
* be one source of truth attached (pdf)
* [front end doc? discuss with Martin]

Important!
* prototype will never be used for development guidance
* design & content will also sign off dev work (visual designs)

## Refinement
Design will:
* refine stories with the dev team
* run through design PDF's
