## Value of documenting design iterations
* discover what we did and why
* re-evaluate decisions
* see how a feature has changed
* see how things tested in research
* give context to new team members
* see what didnâ€™t work

* initial designs
* approaching the problem
* user needs
* hypothesis
* new design approachs

As time goes on we hope to add more examples:
